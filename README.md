## This project is part of the Data Scientist Nanodegree

A non-technical post can be found here: https://medium.com/@markuslnga/write-a-data-science-blog-post-fd04cf0fbb86

## Files and descriptions:

The technical post can be found in the AirbnbPrediction IPython Notebook. All datasets are in the data folder and subfolders for each city.

## Goals and motivation:

We want to explore the factors which influence the price or an Airbnb property. Therefore this projects wants to answer the three following questions:

1. Are the prices stable or do they is there a seasonality?
2. What are the most important factors of the property itself to predict the price?
3. Is city an important predictor for the price? If yes, predicting values for a new city is error-prone

Following steps have to be performed to follow along:

1. `git clone https://github.com/Data-Mastery/Udacity-Data-Science-Blog-Post.git` # Download Repo from Github
2. `pip install -r requirements.txt` # Install dependencies
3. `jupyter notebook` # Open Notebook

## Summary of the results:

The datasets provided by Airbnb are very well suited to predict the price. Further and more accurate analysis could be done integrating the seasonality or the text-reviews into account.
